To make travel easier, the country introduced the Hayya A1 Visa, a simple and convenient option for those visiting for tourism, events, or short business trips. The Hayya A1 Visa is Qatarâ€™s official tourist visa that allows visitors from around the world to enter and stay in Qatar for up to 30 days, with the option to extend for another 30 days. Issued through the online Hayya Portal (hayya.qa), this visa is designed for leisure travel, family visits, events, and short business trips.
